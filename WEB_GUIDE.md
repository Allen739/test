# Web Interface Guide

Welcome to the Software Builder web interface! This guide will help you get started with building software using AI through our intuitive web UI.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone <repository-url>
cd react-cli-coding-agent

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI and/or Anthropic API keys
```

### 2. Start the Web Interface

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Interface Overview

The web interface consists of three main panels:

### Left Panel - File Explorer
- Browse your project's file structure
- Click on folders to expand/collapse them
- Click on files to open them in the editor
- Automatically refreshes when new files are created

### Center Panel - Code Editor
- Full-featured Monaco editor (same as VS Code)
- Syntax highlighting for all major languages
- Auto-completion and IntelliSense
- Multiple cursors (Alt+Click)
- Find and replace (Ctrl+F)
- Save files with Ctrl+S or the Save button

### Right Panel - AI Chat
- Select your AI model from available options
- Type messages to interact with the AI
- Real-time streaming responses
- Scroll through conversation history

## Using the AI Assistant

### Example Prompts

#### Creating New Features
```
"Create a new React component for user authentication with email and password"
"Add a REST API endpoint for fetching user data"
"Implement a dark mode toggle for the application"
```

#### Code Review and Debugging
```
"Review the code in src/agent/CodingAgent.ts for potential bugs"
"Find and fix the error in the authentication logic"
"Optimize the performance of the file loading function"
```

#### Refactoring and Improvements
```
"Refactor this component to use React hooks instead of class components"
"Add TypeScript types to all functions in this file"
"Improve the error handling in the API routes"
```

#### Code Explanation
```
"Explain how the CodingAgent class works"
"What does this function do and how can it be improved?"
"Document this code with JSDoc comments"
```

## Features

### Real-time Code Editing

1. **Open a file** from the file explorer
2. **Edit the code** in the Monaco editor
3. **Save changes** with Ctrl+S or the Save button
4. Changes are immediately written to disk

### AI-Assisted Development

The AI assistant can:
- Generate new code files
- Modify existing code
- Explain complex code
- Debug issues
- Suggest improvements
- Write tests
- Add documentation

### File Operations

The AI can perform file operations through chat:
- Create new files
- Read file contents
- Modify existing files
- Delete files
- List files in directories

### Streaming Responses

All AI responses stream in real-time, so you can see the AI's thought process as it works.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Editor
- **Ctrl+S / Cmd+S** - Save file
- **Ctrl+F / Cmd+F** - Find
- **Ctrl+H / Cmd+H** - Find and replace
- **Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z** - Undo
- **Ctrl+Y / Cmd+Y** - Redo
- **Alt+Click** - Add cursor
- **Ctrl+D / Cmd+D** - Select next occurrence
- **Ctrl+/ / Cmd+/** - Toggle comment

### General
- **Ctrl+B / Cmd+B** - Toggle sidebar (when implemented)
- **Esc** - Close dialogs

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Instructions
Be specific about what you want the AI to do:
- ✅ "Create a React component that displays a list of users with pagination"
- ❌ "Make a user thing"

### 2. Context Matters
Open relevant files in the editor before asking the AI to modify them. The AI can see and reference open files.

### 3. Iterative Development
Break large tasks into smaller steps:
1. Ask the AI to create the basic structure
2. Review the generated code
3. Ask for specific improvements
4. Test and refine

### 4. Review AI-Generated Code
Always review code generated by the AI:
- Check for security issues
- Verify logic correctness
- Ensure it follows your project's conventions
- Test thoroughly

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Building a New Feature

1. **Start a conversation:**
   ```
   "I need to add user authentication to my app. Can you help me plan this?"
   ```

2. **Let the AI suggest an approach:**
   The AI will outline the steps needed

3. **Implement step by step:**
   ```
   "First, create the user authentication service"
   ```

4. **Review and test:**
   Open the generated file, review it, make adjustments

5. **Continue building:**
   ```
   "Now create the login component"
   ```

### Example 2: Debugging

1. **Describe the issue:**
   ```
   "I'm getting an error 'Cannot read property of undefined' in the file explorer"
   ```

2. **Open the problematic file** in the editor

3. **Ask the AI to investigate:**
   ```
   "Can you review the FileExplorer component and find the bug?"
   ```

4. **Apply the fix:**
   The AI will explain the issue and provide a solution

### Example 3: Refactoring

1. **Open the file to refactor**

2. **Ask for specific improvements:**
   ```
   "Refactor this component to use custom hooks for better reusability"
   ```

3. **Review the changes:**
   Compare the before and after

4. **Save and test:**
   Make sure everything still works

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding
- Check your API keys in `.env`
- Verify your internet connection
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Files Not Appearing
- Refresh the page
- Check if the file was created in the correct directory
- Look for error messages in the chat

### Editor Not Saving
- Check file permissions
- Verify the file path is correct
- Look for error messages in browser console

### Slow Performance
- Close unused files
- Clear browser cache
- Restart the development server

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Use the chat history** - Scroll up to reference previous conversations
2. **Be specific** - The more context you provide, the better the AI's responses
3. **Iterate** - Don't expect perfect code on the first try
4. **Learn patterns** - Watch how the AI structures code and learn from it
5. **Combine with editor** - Use the AI for generation, then refine manually in the editor

## Support

For issues and questions:
- Check the main [README.md](README.md)
- Review [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)
- Open an issue on GitHub

## Next Steps
